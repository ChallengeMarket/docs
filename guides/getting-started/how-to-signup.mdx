## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

Our platform supports a variety of crypto wallets for authentication:

1. Visit our homepage
2. Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the top right corner
3. Choose your preferred wallet provider:
   - MetaMask
   - Rainbow Wallet
   - Coinbase Wallet
   - Ledger Wallet
   - Rabby Wallet
   - WalletConnect (for other compatible wallets)
4. Follow your wallet's instructions to complete the connection

## Step 2: Sign the Authentication Message

After connecting your wallet, you'll need to verify ownership:

1. A signature request will appear in your wallet
2. The message will look like: `Login to ChallengeMarket at [timestamp]`
3. Review the message to ensure it's from our platform
4. Sign the message to authenticate (this doesn't cost any gas fees)

> **Note**: Signing this message proves you own the wallet without giving our platform any control over your funds.

## Step 3: Manage Your Profile

Once authenticated, you can customize your profile:

2. Select "Edit Profile" from the dropdown menu
3. In the preferences modal, you can update:
