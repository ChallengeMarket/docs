## Prerequisites

Before creating a challenge, make sure you:
- Have connected your wallet to the platform
- Have enough ETH in your wallet to cover gas fees

If you haven't connected your wallet yet, please follow our [How to Sign-Up](/guides/getting-started/how-to-signup) guide first.

## Step 1: Navigate to the Challenge Creation Page

1. Visit our platform homepage
2. Click on "Explore" in the navigation menu
3. Click the "Create Challenge" button in the top right corner

## Step 2: Set Up Basic Information

Every challenge needs some basic information to help participants understand what it's about:

1. **Banner Image** (optional but recommended)
   - Click the "Upload banner image" area
   - Select an image file from your device (recommended size: 1200x300px)
   - Wait for the image to upload

2. **Title** (required)
   - Enter a clear, descriptive title for your challenge
   - Make it specific and engaging to attract participants

3. **Description** (required)
   - Provide a detailed description of your challenge
   - Include objectives, rules, requirements, and any other relevant information
   - Be as specific as possible to avoid confusion

4. **Category** (required)
   - Select the most appropriate category for your challenge from the dropdown menu

> **Pro Tip**: Need inspiration? Click the "Magic Generate" button at the top of the page to automatically generate challenge details based on AI suggestions.

## Step 3: Configure Timeline & Fees

Set up the timeline and entry fee for your challenge:

1. **Entry Fee** (required)
   - Specify the amount in ETH required to participate in your challenge
   - This creates a reward pool for winners

2. **Submission Deadline** (required)
   - Set the date and time when participants can no longer submit entries
   - Ensure you allow enough time for participants to create quality submissions

3. **Commitment Deadline** (required)
   - Set the date and time when the voting commitment phase ends
   - This must be after the submission deadline

4. **Reveal Deadline** (required)
   - Set the date and time when the voting reveal phase ends
   - This must be after the commitment deadline

> **Note**: Our platform uses a commit-reveal voting mechanism to ensure fair and transparent voting. Participants first commit to their votes (without revealing them), then reveal their votes in a separate phase.

## Step 4: Review and Create

Before finalizing your challenge:

1. Review the challenge preview card on the right side of the screen
2. Check all details for accuracy
3. Make any necessary adjustments to your challenge parameters
4. Click the "Create Challenge" button at the bottom of the page

## Step 5: Confirm the Transaction

After clicking "Create Challenge":

1. Your wallet will prompt you to confirm the transaction
2. Review the gas fees and transaction details
3. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
4. Wait for the transaction to be processed on the blockchain

Once the transaction is confirmed, your challenge will be created and visible on the platform!

## After Creating a Challenge

After your challenge is created:

- Share it with your network to attract participants
- Monitor submissions as they come in
- Prepare to participate in the voting process once the submission period ends
- Engage with participants through comments

Congratulations on creating your challenge! You've now set up an opportunity for the community to engage with your ideas and showcase their skills.
