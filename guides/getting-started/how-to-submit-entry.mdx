## Prerequisites

Before submitting an entry, make sure you:
- Have connected your wallet to the platform
- Have enough ETH in your wallet to cover gas fees and any entry fee required by the challenge
- Have prepared your content (image, video, or other media) for submission

If you haven't connected your wallet yet, please follow our [How to Sign-Up](/guides/getting-started/how-to-signup) guide first.

## Step 1: Find a Challenge to Enter

1. Visit our platform homepage
2. Click on "Explore" in the navigation menu
3. Browse through available challenges
4. Click on a challenge that interests you to view its details

## Step 2: Navigate to the Entry Submission Page

1. On the challenge details page, look for the "Submit Entry" button in the top right corner
2. Click the "Submit Entry" button to navigate to the submission form

> **Note**: The "Submit Entry" button will only be available during the submission phase of a challenge. If the challenge has moved to the commitment or reveal phase, you won't be able to submit an entry.

## Step 3: Upload Your Content

1. **Select Your Content**
   - Click the upload area in the "Content Upload" section
   - Select an image or video file from your device
   - Wait for the file to upload completely (you'll see a progress bar during upload)

2. **Set Thumbnail (for Video Content)**
   - If you uploaded a video, you can set a custom thumbnail
   - Use the video scrubber to find the perfect frame
   - Click "Capture Frame" to set that frame as your thumbnail

## Step 4: Add Entry Details

1. **Content Type** (required)
   - Select the appropriate content type from the dropdown menu (Image, Video, Post, Link, or Other)

2. **Caption** (optional but recommended)
   - Add a descriptive caption for your entry
   - Explain your work, your approach, or how it meets the challenge requirements

3. **Hashtags** (optional)
   - Add relevant hashtags to make your entry more discoverable
   - Separate multiple hashtags with commas (e.g., design, art, creative)

## Step 5: Preview Your Entry

Before submitting, review your entry in the preview panel on the right side of the screen:

- Check how your content appears
- Review your caption and hashtags
- Make any necessary adjustments to your submission

## Step 6: Submit Your Entry

1. Once you're satisfied with your entry, click the "Submit Entry" button at the bottom of the page
2. Your wallet will prompt you to confirm the transaction
3. Review the gas fees and any entry fee required by the challenge
4. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
5. Wait for the transaction to be processed on the blockchain

Once the transaction is confirmed, your entry will be submitted to the challenge!

## After Submitting an Entry

After your entry is submitted:

- Your entry will be visible on the challenge page
- During the commitment phase, other participants can back your entry with their votes
- You can share your entry with your network to gain more support
- You can also back other entries that you find impressive

## Understanding the Voting Process

Our platform uses a commit-reveal voting mechanism to ensure fair and transparent voting:

1. **Commitment Phase**: Participants commit to their votes without revealing them
2. **Reveal Phase**: Participants reveal their previously committed votes
3. **Resolution**: After the reveal phase ends, the challenge can be resolved and winners determined

This two-step process helps prevent bias and ensures the integrity of the voting process.

## Tips for a Successful Entry

- **Read the Challenge Requirements Carefully**: Make sure your entry meets all the criteria specified by the challenge creator.
- **Submit Early**: This gives you more time to promote your entry and gather support.
- **High-Quality Content**: Ensure your images or videos are clear and well-produced.
- **Compelling Caption**: Write a thoughtful caption that explains your work and how it addresses the challenge.
- **Relevant Hashtags**: Use hashtags that accurately represent your entry and the challenge theme.

Congratulations on submitting your entry! You're now part of the creative community competing in this challenge.
