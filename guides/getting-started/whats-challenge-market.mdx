## Core Features

- **Challenge Creation**: Creators define off-chain metadata (banner, title, description, category) and on-chain parameters (entry fee, submission, commit and reveal deadlines). Only essential parameters are stored on-chain to save gas.
- **Verifiable Submissions**: Participants pay the entry fee to submit entries, all cryptographically verified for authenticity.
- **Commit-Reveal Voting**: Voters first commit their choices, then reveal them later. This prevents vote manipulation and ensures fair outcomes.
- **Reward Distribution**: After voting ends, the winning entry creator is paid automatically. Voters who backed the winner can claim proportional rewards based on their stake.

## How It Works

1. **Create a Challenge** → define metadata and on-chain parameters.
2. **Submit Entries** → participants pay the entry fee and upload submissions.
3. **Commit Votes** → community members lock in their vote choices.
4. **Reveal Votes** → voters reveal their commitments.
5. **Resolve & Claim Rewards** → the winner is determined automatically, their prize is sent and supporting voters can claim rewards.

## Benefits

- **Creators**: Launch challenges quickly without funding a reward pool upfront.
- **Participants**: Compete for rewards generated entirely from entry fees.
- **Voters**: Earn rewards for backing the best entries, using a fair, manipulation-resistant voting process.

## Technology

- **Smart Contracts** handle rules, voting and payouts.
- **Commit-Reveal** prevents front-running and vote manipulation.
- **Web3 Integration** ensures seamless wallet-based interactions.
- **Off-Chain Metadata** reduces gas costs while preserving transparency.

ChallengeMarket combines blockchain fairness with a simple interface so anyone can confidently create, join and vote on challenges knowing results are transparent and enforced automatically.
