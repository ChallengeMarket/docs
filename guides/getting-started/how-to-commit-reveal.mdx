## What is Commit-Reveal Voting?

Commit-reveal is a two-phase voting mechanism designed to prevent bias and ensure fair voting:

1. **Commit Phase**: You submit a hidden vote (commitment) without revealing your choice
2. **Reveal Phase**: You reveal your previously committed vote

This approach prevents voters from being influenced by others' choices and protects against last-minute voting strategies.

## Prerequisites

Before participating in commit-reveal voting, make sure you:
- Have connected your wallet to the platform
- Have enough ETH in your wallet to cover both the voting stake and gas fees
- Are familiar with the challenge entries you want to vote on

If you haven't connected your wallet yet, please follow our [How to Sign-Up](/guides/getting-started/how-to-signup) guide first.

## Step 1: Browse Challenge Entries

1. Navigate to the challenge page
2. Scroll down to the "Entries" section
3. Review all submitted entries carefully
4. Decide which entry you want to vote for and how much ETH you want to stake

> **Note**: Your stake amount represents your voting power. The more ETH you stake, the more influence your vote has on the outcome.

## Step 2: Commit Your Vote (Commitment Phase)

During the commitment phase (after the submission deadline but before the commitment deadline):

1. Navigate to the entry you want to vote for
2. Click the "Vote" button
3. Enter the amount of ETH you want to stake
4. Click "Commit Vote"
5. Confirm the transaction in your wallet

> **Important**: At this stage, you're not sending your stake yet - you're only committing to your vote. The platform will store a cryptographic hash of your voting intention.

After committing:
- You'll see a "Vote Committed" status for that entry
- Your vote choice and stake amount remain private
- You cannot change your commitment once submitted

## Step 3: Reveal Your Vote (Reveal Phase)

During the reveal phase (after the commitment deadline but before the reveal deadline):

1. Navigate back to the challenge page
2. Find the entry you committed to vote for
3. Click the "Reveal Vote" button
4. Your previously committed vote details will be automatically loaded
5. Click "Reveal Vote" to confirm
6. Approve the transaction in your wallet, which will include sending your stake amount

> **Critical**: You must reveal your vote during the reveal phase, or your vote won't count. Set a reminder if needed!

## Step 4: Wait for Challenge Resolution

After the reveal deadline:
1. The challenge will be automatically resolved
2. The entry with the highest total stake wins
3. If you voted for the winning entry, you'll receive your stake back plus a portion of the reward pool
4. If you voted for a non-winning entry, your stake will be distributed to the winning voters

## How to Claim Your Rewards

If you voted for the winning entry:

1. Navigate to the challenge page after resolution
2. Click the "Claim Rewards" button
3. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
4. Your rewards will be transferred to your wallet

## Understanding the Timeline

A challenge has several important deadlines:
- **Submission Deadline**: Last day to submit entries
- **Commitment Deadline**: Last day to commit votes
- **Reveal Deadline**: Last day to reveal votes

These deadlines are displayed on the challenge page. Make sure to commit and reveal your votes before their respective deadlines.

## Tips for Successful Voting

- **Don't wait until the last minute**: Blockchain transactions can sometimes take time to process
- **Keep track of your commitments**: Make note of which entries you've committed to and the stake amounts
- **Set calendar reminders**: Don't miss the reveal phase deadline
- **Consider gas fees**: Factor in transaction costs when planning your stake amount
- **Vote thoughtfully**: Your stake is at risk if you vote for a non-winning entry

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: "Invalid commitment" error when revealing
**Solution**: Ensure you're revealing the same entry and stake amount that you committed to

**Problem**: Can't find the "Reveal Vote" button
**Solution**: Check if the reveal phase has started. If the commitment phase is still active, you'll need to wait

**Problem**: Transaction fails when revealing vote
**Solution**: Ensure you have enough ETH to cover both your stake amount and gas fees

Congratulations! You now understand how to participate in commit-reveal voting on our platform. This mechanism ensures fair and transparent voting while protecting the integrity of the challenge.
