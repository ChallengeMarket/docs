## Core Features

### Transparent Challenge Creation
Anyone can create a challenge by defining parameters such as entry fees, submission deadlines, and reward structures. All challenge details are stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.

### Verifiable Submissions
Participants can submit entries to challenges during the submission phase. Each submission is cryptographically verified to prevent tampering and ensure authenticity.

### Secure Commit-Reveal Voting
ChallengeMarket employs a sophisticated commit-reveal voting mechanism to prevent manipulation:
- **Commitment Phase**: Voters commit to their choices without revealing them, preventing bandwagon effects
- **Reveal Phase**: Voters reveal their commitments, with the system verifying that reveals match the original commitments
- **Resolution**: After voting ends, winners are determined based on the total stake backing each entry

### Automatic Reward Distribution
Smart contracts automatically distribute rewards to:
- Challenge winners (entry submitters)
- Voters who backed winning entries
- A small portion goes to the platform treasury

## How It Works

1. **Challenge Creation**: Creators define challenge parameters and deposit the initial reward pool
2. **Submission Period**: Participants submit entries by paying the required entry fee
3. **Commitment Period**: Community members commit their votes by staking cryptocurrency
4. **Reveal Period**: Voters reveal their commitments to finalize their votes
5. **Resolution**: The system automatically determines winners and distributes rewards
